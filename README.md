*Enlightenment Founation Library (EFL)* is a collection of libraries for handling many common tasks a
developer may have such as data structures, communication, rendering, widgets and more.

## Discussions

[GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/discussions/quickstart) is a feature to enable fluid and open discussions within the community
for topics that are not related to code, unlike issues.

This is an experiment we are trying in our repositories to see if it helps move discussions out of issues so that issues remain actionable by the team or members of the community. There should be no expectation that EFL development team members are regular participants in the discussions. Individual EFL development team members may choose to participate in discussions, but the expectation is that community members help drive discussions so that team members can focus on issues.
