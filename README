POLICY FOR SUPPORT OF DISTRIBUTIONS AND ARCHITECTURES:
        systemd main branch and latest major or stable releases are generally
        expected to compile on current versions of popular distributions (at
        least all non-EOL versions of Fedora, Debian unstable/testing/stable,
        latest Ubuntu LTS and non-LTS releases, openSUSE Tumbleweed/Leap,
        CentOS Stream 8 and 9, up-to-date Arch, etc.)  We will generally
        attempt to support also other non-EOL versions of various distros.
        Features which would break compilation on slightly older distributions
        will only be introduced if there are significant reasons for this
        (i.e. supporting them interferes with development or requires too many
        resources to support). In some cases backports of specific libraries or
        tools might be required.

        The policy is similar for architecture support. systemd is regularly
        tested on popular architectures (currently amd64, i386, arm64, ppc64el,
        and s390x), but should compile and work also on other architectures, for
        which support has been added. systemd will emit warnings when
        architecture-specific constants are not defined.

STABLE BRANCHES AND BACKPORTS:
        Stable branches with backported patches are available in the
        efl-stable repo at https://github.com/dimmus/efl-stable.

        Stable branches are started for certain releases of EFL and named
        after them, e.g. v2.0.1-stable. Stable branches are managed by
        distribution maintainers on an as needed basis. See
        https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/EFL/Backports for some
        more information and examples.
