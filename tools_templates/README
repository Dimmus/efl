EFL DEV TOOLS

This repository is intended for miscellaneous tools, utilities, 
configurations and anything that helps with EFL development, 
but aren't directly related to building EFL. Some of the tools 
included may be used stand-alone, others expect EFL source code 
to be available.


USAGE:

    While this is a stand-alone repository, some of the scripts
    which access EFL source code assume this repository will be 
    located at 'scripts' folder within EFL source code repository. 

    Some tools also rely on the EFL binary, this is assumed 
    to be located at '../build'.
