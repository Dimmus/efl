# EFL Project Licensing

## Main License

The EFL project uses single-line references to Unique License Identifiers as
defined by the Linux Foundation's SPDX project (https://spdx.org/). The line in
each individual source file identifies the license applicable to that file.

The current set of valid, predefined SPDX identifiers can be found on the SPDX
License List at https://spdx.org/licenses/.

The 'licenses/' directory contains all the licenses used by the sources included in
the EFL project source tree.

Unless otherwise noted, the EFL project sources are licensed under the terms
and conditions of the **GNU Lesser General Public License v2.1 or later**.

New sources that cannot be distributed under LGPL-2.1-or-later will no longer
be accepted for inclusion in the systemd project to maintain license uniformity.
